In this talk, recent progress on MEMS sensors based on coupled resonators are dicussed. In particular, the concept and technical advantages (in terms of improved sensitivity and long-term stability) of MEMS <b>mode-localized</b> sensors are presented. Nonlinear effects and modal interactions are proposed to enhance the sensor performance. Future outlook in this area is also discussed.
