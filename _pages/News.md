* Feb. 2022: Our paper titled: <b>"A Scale Factor Enhancement Method Based on Parametric Modulation for a Resonant MEMS Accelerometer"</b> has been accepted for poster presentation at the [2022 Joint Conference of the European Frequency & Time Forum (EFTF) and the IEEE International Frequency Control Symposium (IFCS)](https://eftf-ifcs2022.sciencesconf.org). Well done, PhD candidate Jingqian Xi and Dr. Yuan Wang!!

* Feb. 2022: Super excited on embarking on a new chapter of my career at the University of York, UK, on the first day of the Lunar New Year 2022 (Year of Tiger)!! Really grateful for all the great times share with my colleagues and students at Huazhong University of Science and Technology!
