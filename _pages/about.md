About me
------
I am currently an academic and researcher in the field of MEMS at [Center for Gravitational Experiments](http://ggg.hust.edu.cn/), [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](http://www.hust.edu.cn/). I am born and raised in the lovely city of [Wuhan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan), China, only to leave my home to London, UK at the age of 22. Then I spent the next 9 wonderful years in London, Southampton, Oxford and Cambridge. I have studied, worked, traveled many palces, played countless football games, befriended with many beautiful people, and met the love of my life in those cities. Afterwards, we packed those memories and embraced the next chapter of our lives, and moved back to my home town, Wuhan, and joined my alma mater.

My research
------

"If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of <b>[energy], <b>[frequency] and <b>[vibration]." ---<cite>Nikola Tesla</cite>

My research interests are mainly micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) based precision sensors. A micro-electro-mechanical system consists of a movable micro-scale device (the thinniest part of the device can be a few times thinner than a human hair), low noise electronics (as the signal on these tiny devices is generally very tiny), and some measurement circuits to measure the output. So I am interested in all the systems here, from the fabrication techniues to make the micro-scale devices, to the associated precision electronics. To know more about my research, feel free to browse this website.
