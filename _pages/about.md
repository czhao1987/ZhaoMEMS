Welcome to Dr. Chun Zhao's website!

<!--About me
------
I am currently an academic and researcher in the field of MEMS at [Center for Gravitational Experiments](http://ggg.hust.edu.cn/), [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](http://www.hust.edu.cn/). I am born and raised in the lovely city of [Wuhan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan), China, only to leave my home to London, UK at the age of 22. Then I spent the next 9 wonderful years in London, Southampton, Oxford and Cambridge. I have studied, worked, traveled many palces, played countless football games, befriended with many beautiful people, and met the love of my life in those cities. Afterwards, we packed those memories and embraced the next chapter of our lives, and moved back to my home town, Wuhan, and joined my alma mater.-->
