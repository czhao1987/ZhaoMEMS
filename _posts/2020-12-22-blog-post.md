Minaturization enabled fitting a phone into our pocket, bringing the prosperity of our current digital age. However, [the scaling law of miniaturization](http://www-bsac.eecs.berkeley.edu/projects/ee245/Lectures/lecturepdfs/Lecture%206%20Scaling.pdf) does not make it easy for us. The objective of this research is to address this challenge using <b>modal interactions</b> within micro-devices.

Modes of vibration
======

Systems in the nature have multiple [<b>modes of vibration</b>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_mode), see these two amazing videos for demonstration of modes ([video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJAgrUBF4w&t=144s), [video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnH2ltfW48U)). Modes of vibration are associated with <b>frequency and energy</b>, which can also be related to [<b>energy levels in quantum mechanics</b>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_level).

Modal interactions
======

Typically these modes are <b>uncoupled</b>, <i>i.e.</i> the coupling is zero or negligible. Therefore, each modes are more or less isolated from other modes. Through modal interactions, we are able to take full advantages of the <b>energy</b> from other modes, and introduce interesting physical phenomena into the systems.

Mode localization
-----

One of the interesting phenomena is [<b>mode localization</b>](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/27073/0000063.pdf;sequence=1), an extension from the famous [<b>Anderson Localization</b>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson_localization), named after Nobel Laureate [<b>P. W. Anderson</b>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_W._Anderson). This part of research is essentially an extension from my previous work on <b>Mode-localized Sensors</b>. Utilizing this effect, the sensitivity of MEMS sensors can be significantly enhanced, and the noise floor can also achieve sub-Î¼g/Hz<sup>1/2</sup> level.

Mode interactions with parametric pump
-----

One way to improve the sensitivity of mode-localized sensor is to apply a parametric pump signal, which periodically modulates the stiffness of a resonator. This allows for the creation of a tunable virtual link (<b>dynamic coupling</b>) between two coupled modes, which can be orders of magnitude weaker/stronger than the existing coupling, thus further improving the sensitivity and resolution.

Sensitivity transfer
-----

Another interesting phenomena recently discovered is sensitivity transfer between modes. Essentially, we are able to "<b>clone</b>" the sensitivity of another mode to the desired mode of operation. In this way, we are able to enhance the sensitivity of a MEMS sensor. Additionally, if desired, <i>e.g.</i> for MEMS timing references, the sensitivity to ambient fluctuations can also be reduced by "cloning" the other modes with much lower sensitivity. ore details to follow...

###### * Sensitivity transfer from another mode. More details of this work will be presented at [<b>IEEE MEMS 2021</b>](https://www.mems21.org/program/MEMS2021_Program.pdf) as an oral presentation, stay tuned...


Q-factor enhancement
-----

One key figure-of-merit of MEMS sensors based on resonators is the [<b>Q-factor</b>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_factor). Typically, the higher the Q-factor, the better. Currently, we are also invesitgating Q-factor enhancement techniques based on modal interactions. A few papers are currently being prepared. More details to follow...
