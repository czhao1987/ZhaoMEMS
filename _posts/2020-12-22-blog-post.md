Minaturization enabled fitting a phone into our pocket, bringing the prosperity of our current digital age. However, [the scaling law of miniaturization](http://www-bsac.eecs.berkeley.edu/projects/ee245/Lectures/lecturepdfs/Lecture%206%20Scaling.pdf) does not make it easy for us. The objective of this research is to address this challenge using <b>modal interactions</b> within micro-devices.

Modes of vibration
======

Systems in the nature have multiple [<b>modes of vibration</b>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_mode), see these two amazing videos for demonstration of modes ([video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJAgrUBF4w&t=144s), [video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnH2ltfW48U)). Modes of vibration are associated with <b>frequency and energy</b>, which can also be related to [<b>energy levels in quantum mechanics</b>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_level).

Modal interactions
======

Typically these modes are <b>uncoupled</b>, <i>i.e.</i> the coupling is zero or negligible. Therefore, each modes are more or less isolated from other modes. Through modal interactions, we are able to take full advantages of the <b>energy</b> from other modes, and introduce interesting physical phenomena into the systems.

Mode localization
-----

One of the interesting phenomena is [<b>mode localization</b>](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/27073/0000063.pdf;sequence=1), an extension from the Nobel Prize winning [<b>Anderson Localization</b>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson_localization), named after American physicist [<b>P. W. Anderson</b>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_W._Anderson). This part of research is essentially an extension from my previous work on <b>Mode-localized Sensors</b>. Utilizing this effect, the sensitivity of MEMS sensors can be significantly enhanced, and the noise floor can also achieve sub-Î¼g/Hz<sup>1/2</sup> level.

Sensitivity transfer
-----

Another interesting phenomena recently discovered is sensitivity transfer between modes. Essentially, we are able to "<b>clone</b>" the sensitivity of another mode to the desired mode of operation. In this way, we are able to enhance the sensitivity of a MEMS sensor. Additionally, if desired, <i>e.g.</i> for MEMS timing references, the sensitivity to ambient fluctuations can also be reduced by "cloning" the other modes with much lower sensitivity. More details of this work will be presented at [<b>IEEE MEMS 2021</b>](https://www.mems21.org/program/MEMS2021_Program.pdf) as an oral presentation, more details to follow...

Q-factor enhancement
-----

One key figure-of-merit of MEMS sensors based on resonators is the [<b>Q-factor</b>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_factor). Typically, the higher the Q-factor, the better. Currently, we are also invesitgating Q-factor enhancement techniques based on modal interactions. A few papers are currently being prepared. More details to follow...
