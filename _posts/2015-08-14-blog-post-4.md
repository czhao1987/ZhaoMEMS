Minaturization enabled fitting a phone into our pocket, bringing the prosperity of our current digital age. However, [the scaling law of miniaturization](http://www-bsac.eecs.berkeley.edu/projects/ee245/Lectures/lecturepdfs/Lecture%206%20Scaling.pdf) does not make it easy for us. The objective of this research is to address this challenge using <b>modal interactions</b> within micro-devices.

Modes of vibration
======

Systems in the nature have multiple [<b>modes of vibration</b>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_mode), see these two amazing videos for demonstration of modes ([video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJAgrUBF4w&t=144s), [video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnH2ltfW48U)). Modes of vibration are associated with <b>frequency and energy</b>, which can also be related to [<b>energy levels in quantum mechanics</b>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_level).

Modal interactions
======

Typically these modes are <b>uncoupled</b>, <i>i.e.</i> the coupling is zero or negligible. Therefore, each modes live more or less isolated from other modes.
