## Abstract
In this paper, for the first time, the mass sensitivity of a 3-DoF mode localized electrostatically coupled resonator is investigated and characterized under atmospheric pressure. A reversible method is used in which nanoparticles are added on and removed from one resonator of the 3-DOF coupled resonator system. Furthermore, a comparison of three mass sensitivity characterization methods was carried out: resonance frequency shift, resonance vibration amplitude change and resonance vibration amplitude ratio. MATLAB/SIMULINK and COMSOL Multiphysics models for the 3-DoF coupled resonator system are presented. The simulation results and theoretical calculations are in good agreement with the experimental data. The results show that a 3-DOF mode localized coupled resonator has potential to be employed for biosensing applications. <br />
