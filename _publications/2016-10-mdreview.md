## Abstract
In this paper, we review a recent technology development based on coupled MEMS resonators that has the potential of fundamentally transforming MEMS resonant sensors. Conventionally MEMS resonant sensors use only a single resonator as the sensing element, and the output of the sensor is typically a frequency shift caused by the external stimulus altering the mechanical properties, i.e. the mass or stiffness, of the resonator. Recently, transduction techniques utilizing additional coupled resonators have emerged. The mode-localized resonant sensor is one example of such a technique. If the mode localization effect is utilized, the vibrational amplitude pattern of the resonators changes as a function of the quantity to be measured. Compared to using frequency shift as an output signal, the sensitivity can be improved by several orders of magnitude. Another feature of the mode-localized sensors is the common mode rejection abilities due to the differential structure. These advantages have opened doors for new sensors with unprecedented sensitivity. <br />
