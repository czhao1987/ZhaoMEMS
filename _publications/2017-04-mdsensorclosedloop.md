## Abstract
This letter presents the first experimental results on the closed-loop characterization of a mode-localized microelectromechanical resonator system. Comparisons between the closed-loop oscillator approach and the open-loop frequency sweep approach show good agreement of output metrics including the amplitude ratios and mode frequencies. This new approach enables real-time measurements using emerging mode-localized resonant sensors and represents an important step toward realizing sensors based on this measurement principle. <br />
