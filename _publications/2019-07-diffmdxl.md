## Abstract
A novel differential conﬁguration of a highresolution mode-localized resonant SOI-MEMS accelerometer is presented in this paper. An effective maximum scale factor of 11/g and a bias-stability of 2.96µg is demonstrated. A minimum noise ﬂoor of 3µg/Hz<sup>1/2</sup> is shown for device operation in an optimum working region. A large bandwidth of 350Hz is reported and methods to electronically tune the working bandwidth are described. These results benchmark mode-localized accelerometers favourably with respect to other high-end low-g commercial MEMS accelerometers. <br />
