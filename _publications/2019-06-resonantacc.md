## Abstract
This letter presents a high-performance resonant MEMS accelerometer comprising of a single force-sensitive vibrating beam element sandwiched between two inertial masses. The accelerometer demonstrates a noise floor of 98 ng/Hz<sup>1/2</sup> and a bias stability of 56 ng under ambient conditions, corresponding to a frequency noise floor of 0.77 ppb/Hz<sup>1/2</sup> and a frequency bias stability of 0.43 ppb. These are the best results achieved for a MEMS accelerometer employing the resonant sensing paradigm to-date.
